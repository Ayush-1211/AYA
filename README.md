## AYA - Automation for Your Ankle-biters

* This project will assist parents who require extra help in taking care of their 0-5 year old babies all the time. For more understanding, we have done additional research on the common problems that parents face while taking care of their babies globally. Thus, our main motive is to give a functioning system that can assist parents to look after their children from any place.

* The system will assist the user to keep track of the baby's health care, proper food planning, tracking doctor’s appointments, medication, and vaccination for their kid. We will develop a simplified system where a user can monitor their babies using 24*7 real-time camera surveillance. Features like notifying parents regarding the doctor’s appointment, light control in the baby’s room, playing soft songs or lullaby for the baby, alerting if a baby is crying and the baby's temperature.
